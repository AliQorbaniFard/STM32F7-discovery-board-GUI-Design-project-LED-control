## 🎯 Project Summary

This project transforms a basic LED control into an **interactive touchscreen experience** using the **STM32F7 Discovery Board** and a custom **TouchGFX GUI**.

💡 When you touch the animated **Sly Fox** logo on the screen:
- The fox begins to **glow**
- An **LED turns ON**
- Touch it again to **turn everything OFF**

🔁 Repeat this as many times as you like — it’s fast, smooth, and visually satisfying!

## 🧠 Features

- 🖥️ Sleek GUI made with **TouchGFX Designer**
- 🦊 Custom fox logo with glow effect on touch
- 💡 LED toggles with GUI interaction
- 🧼 Clean CubeIDE project structure
- 🔁 Fully responsive toggle logic with debouncing

## 🔧 Tools Used

| Tool/Framework     | Purpose                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| STM32F7 Discovery   | Main development board         |
| TouchGFX Designer   | GUI creation & animation       |
| STM32CubeMX         | Peripheral setup               |
| STM32CubeIDE        | Code integration and upload    |
| C / HAL             | Embedded firmware logic        |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The GUI is created with **TouchGFX** and loaded onto the LCD.
2. The **fox logo** is set as a touch-sensitive object.
3. When touched:
   - The LED toggles ON/OFF
   - A glow effect activates/deactivates around the fox
4. LED state is retained until touched again.

## 💡 Inspiration

Even a basic LED project can become fun and **user-friendly** with the right GUI.  
Touchscreens + microcontrollers = endless creativity!

---

## 🛠️ Future Ideas

- Add multi-object touch interaction (e.g., toggle 2 LEDs)
- Include animation or sound effects
- Add UART logging or status display
